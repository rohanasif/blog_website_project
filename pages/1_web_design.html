            <p class="blog-description"><strong>Web design</strong> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in
                the production
                and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user
                interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user
                experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams
                covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term
                "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side)
                design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the
                broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up
                to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                <p class="blog-content">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
                    documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for the appearance of the document.
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                    such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                    Tags such as 'img' and 'input' directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
                    'p'surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                    Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
                    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of
                    HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the 'canvas' element, in
                    collaboration with javascript.</p>

                <p class="blog-content">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
                    the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML
                    dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                    alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
                    and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                    control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                    formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                    repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
                    load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
                    for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
                    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                    applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
                    predictable.
                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media
                    type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
                    operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

                    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML,
                    SVG, and XUL.</p>
